# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to me. It is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect from you via any instances of `for-science` that I have deployed.

`for-science` may be deployed by third parties without my knowledge or consent. Please be aware that I have no control over the content and practices of those third parties, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

I only ask for personal information when I truly need it to provide a service to you. I collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. I also let you know why I'm collecting it and how it will be used.

`for-science` is a "stateless" service, and (with one exception) does not persist any information (including personal information) it receives from the Discord APIs or elsewhere.  The one exception is that some personal information may appear in log files.  These log files are deleted periodically, typically weekly (see [Heroku's documentation on log history limits](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#log-history-limits)).

Regardless of source, I donâ€™t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to do so by law.

`for-science` may send links to external sites that are not operated by me. Please be aware that I have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

You are free to refuse my request for your personal information, with the understanding that I may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

Your continued use of my deployed instance(s) of `for-science` will be regarded as acceptance of these practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how I handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact me.

This policy is effective as of 1 July 2020.
