# for-science

A small [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that you can send Clojure code to, to experiment with the language, demonstrate core language principles, or just mess about.  Note: only supports the subset of Clojure's core provided by the [Small Clojure Interpreter](https://github.com/borkdude/sci).

Please review the [privacy policy](https://github.com/pmonks/for-science/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) before interacting with the bot.

## Adding the Bot to Your Discord Server

If you're an administrator of a server, [click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=854190844084355082&scope=bot&permissions=2148006976) and follow the instructions.

## Running Your Own Copy of the Bot

### Obtaining API Keys

Configure a Discord bot using the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers), obtaining an API key.  Detailed instructions on this process are provided in the [`discljord` project](https://github.com/IGJoshua/discljord).

### Running the Bot

Currently the bot is only distributed in source form, so regardless of how you intend to deploy it, you'll need to clone this repository locally.

#### Direct Execution

1. Either set environment variables as described in the default [`config.edn` file](https://github.com/pmonks/for-science/blob/main/resources/config.edn), or copy that file somewhere else and hardcode the values in the file directly.
2. If you set the environment variables in the previous step run `clj -M:run`, otherwise run `clj -M:run -c /path/to/your/config.edn`

### Developer Workflow

The `for-science` source repository has two permanent branches: `main` and `dev`.  **All development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in feature branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs must also be submitted against `dev`; the `main` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `main` will be rejected.

This model allows otherwise unrelated changes to be batched up in the `dev` branch, integration tested there, and then released en masse to the `main` branch.  The `main` branch is configured to auto-deploy to a production environment, and therefore that branch must only contain tested, functioning code.
